# Virtual Reality Therapy (VRT)
#### Combined research into virtual reality and exposure therapy with development done in Unity and C# to create a prototype for a low-cost, virtual-reality, phobia-therapy application.

### About VRT
The VRT prototype helped users overcome acrophobia, the fear of heights. This was done by constructing a city in Unity 3D and allowing the user to safely traverse the rooftops without being able to fall off.
<br>
The application can run on any phone with Android 4.4 or newer, alongside a Google Cardboard headset. Because of this, a published version of this app would have been cheap to use.
<br><br>

### Process
Throughout the development period, I was the manager and lead developer for a team of five other students.
<br>
Since this was my first time managing a large scale project, I learned how to ensure my team was meeting deadlines and that team members were on task.
<br>
Our team consisted of two developers, two level designers, and two researchers. The developers and level designers worked closely together to test user controls and level features.
<br>
The researchers contacted local doctors for their input, and found out what phobias were most common and most likely to be treated.
<br><br>

### Result
VRT was presented to Fortune 500 executives during the Showcase Project Competition at TechOlympics in February 2017. Our team placed third out of seventeen teams. 
<br>
Due to busy schedules of team members, development unfortunately did not continue after TechOlympics.
<br>
Given more time to work on VRT, the team planned to implement levels for fear of water and spiders. Additionally, we would have reached out to local hospitals to receive feedback on our application.
