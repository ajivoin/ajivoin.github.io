### About Flappy McKain
Flappy McKain is a derivative of Flappy Bird. It features (with his permission, of course) my high school computer science teacher, Mr. McKain.<br>
The game was originally made as a fun project for our final assignment, but has since received requests from many students to be made available.<br>
Flappy McKain is free to enjoy on all Android devices running Android Jelly Bean (4.1) or newer.
<br><br>

### Technology Used
Flappy McKain is built in [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) using C# for scripting.<br>
It utilizes the following plugins:
- [Play Games for Unity plugin](https://github.com/playgameservices/play-games-plugin-for-unity) for high score and achievement management.
- [unity-android-rotation-lock](https://github.com/HiddenVariableStudios/unity-android-rotation-lock) to fix a Unity Engine bug.
