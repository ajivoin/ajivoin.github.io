# [GroupMe Analysis](https://jivoin.com/groupme-analysis)  
We wanted to bring data visualization to everyday social media users, not just people who know how to use visualization tools.  
So we did by creating this GroupMe chat history visualization application.

We came in **first place** at [DATA I/O](https://bdaaosu.org/dataio.php) 2018 in the data visualization category.
