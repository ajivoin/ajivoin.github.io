    We wanted to bring data visualization to everyday social media users, not just people who know how to use visualization tools.
    <br />
    So we did by creating this GroupMe chat history visualization application.
    <br /><br />
    We came in <b>first place</b> at <a href="https://bdaaosu.org/dataio.php">Data I/O</a> 2018 in the Data Visualization category.
    <br /><br />

    Large businesses and universities have WiFi access points everywhere. Can these be utilized to more intelligently turn on air conditioning and heating, leading to vast energy savings?
    <br /><br />
    At <a href="http://hack.osu.edu/2018/">HackOHI/O 2018</a>, we put together an application and physical model to showcase our answer to this question.
    <br /><br />
    Our goal was to take advantage of vast wireless internet networks to create a smarter climate control solution. We accomplished this by combining network connection data of access points with temperature and proximity readings.

    Combined research into virtual reality and exposure therapy with development done in Unity and C# to create a prototype for a low-cost, virtual-reality, phobia-therapy application.
    <br /><br />
    The VRT prototype helped users overcome acrophobia, the fear of heights. This was done by constructing a city in Unity 3D and allowing the user to safely traverse the rooftops without being able to fall off.
    <br /><br />
    The application is compatible with Android 4.4 or newer. All a user would need is a Google Cardboard headset, which makes this application cheap to use.
    Throughout the development period, I was the manager and lead developer for a team of five other students.
    <br /><br />
    VRT was presented to Fortune 500 executives during the Showcase Project Competition at TechOlympics in February 2017. Our team placed third out of seventeen teams.
