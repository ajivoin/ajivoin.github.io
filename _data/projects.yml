    Many people struggle with remembering to take their medications. We wanted to leverage smart technology to help people remember to take their medicine!
    <br/><br/>
    At Hack OHI/O 2019, we created a smart pill dispenser that reminds people to take their medications. Patients or their caretaker can specify a schedule for each of their medications. The dispenser keeps track of how many pills are left, what times the medication is dispensed, and if the pills are actually taken.
    <br/><br/>
    We built a mobile-friendly web app where the medication schedule is entered so the pills are dispensed at the correct time. The medication history is visible, showing if pills were taken, and if so, when they were taken. Text notifications are sent out when the pill is dispensed, if the pill is still not taken after a specified amount of time, and when a refill is needed.
    <br/><br/>
    A physical prototype was constructed to show our idea in action. Hardware components include an Arduino, NodeMCU, servo motors, a display, and an ultrasonic sensor. The dispenser communicated with the web app over Wi-Fi.
    <br/><br/>
    Our project got third place overall at Hack OHI/O 2019, Ohio State's flagship hackathon with over 800 attendees.
    <br/><br/>
    Web app development was done with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. Arduino development was done with C and C++.

    Have you ever listened to Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlist and wondered why a certain song was recommended to you? It happens to us quite often. We sought to find what songs we listened to in the past influenced what songs were recommended.
    <br/><br/>
    Spotify’s API provides a lot of information about songs, such as its energy, danceability, speechiness, acousticness. We utilized this data from the API to create a linear regression model for these factors so we could determine if songs were similar. This model was utilized in an application where any user can sign in and specify a song in order to find what they listened to that could have caused the recommendation.
    <br/><br/>
    We came in first place at Data I/O 2019 in the best presentation category.

    We wanted to bring data visualization to everyday social media users, not just people who know how to use visualization tools.
    <br />
    So we did by creating this GroupMe chat history visualization application.
    <br /><br />
    We came in <b>first place</b> at <a href="https://bdaaosu.org/dataio.php">Data I/O</a> 2018 in the Data Visualization category.

    Large businesses and universities have WiFi access points everywhere. Can these be utilized to more intelligently turn on air conditioning and heating, leading to vast energy savings?
    <br /><br />
    At <a href="http://hack.osu.edu/2018/">HackOHI/O 2018</a>, we put together an application and physical model to showcase our answer to this question.
    <br /><br />
    Our goal was to take advantage of vast wireless internet networks to create a smarter climate control solution. We accomplished this by combining network connection data of access points with temperature and proximity readings.

    Combined research into virtual reality and exposure therapy with development done in Unity and C# to create a prototype for a low-cost, virtual-reality, phobia-therapy application.
    <br /><br />
    The VRT prototype helped users overcome acrophobia, the fear of heights. This was done by constructing a city in Unity 3D and allowing the user to safely traverse the rooftops without being able to fall off.
    <br /><br />
    The application is compatible with Android 4.4 or newer. All a user would need is a Google Cardboard headset, which makes this application cheap to use.
    Throughout the development period, I was the manager and lead developer for a team of five other students.
    <br /><br />
    VRT was presented to Fortune 500 executives during the Showcase Project Competition at TechOlympics in February 2017. Our team placed third out of seventeen teams.
